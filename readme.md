# LOGOS

Lisp interpreter and compiler implemented in line with CommonLisp (CLtL2) with 486 assembly language.
It runs on IBM-compatible DOS PCs and NEC-9801 series with go32 DOS-extender.

The source codes are written in a translater for 486 but the translater was lost and not included in this repository.
Some of the source codes may be slightly corrupted at the extraction from the archives. Please refer to the original archives with LZH extention.
