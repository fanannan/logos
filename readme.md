# LOGOS

Lisp interpreter and compiler implemented in line with CommonLisp standard (CLtL2) with 386/486 assembly language.
It runs on IBM-compatible DOS PCs and NEC PC-9801 series with go32 DOS-extender. The source codes for the interpreter are under 'source' directory and the codes for compiler are under 'executable' directory. The compiiler is written by the lisp itself and generates 386/486 native machine codes. Refer to LOGOS.DOC under 'executable' for detail (descriptions are all in Japanese language).

The source codes are coded for a translater for 386/486 CPUs. Some of the source codes may be slightly corrupted at the extraction and the decoding from the original archives (probably you can fix the trouble with the original archives (with LZH extention) in the repository).
 Unfortunately I had lost the source codes for the translater, so that is not included in this repository.
